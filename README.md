# NBA-MVP-Predictor-Model


The purpose of this project is to create a model that is able to predict the points per game of players who play more than a certain threshold.

Potential Use and Stakeholders

This project is of potential interest to Sports betting companies, individuals who would like to make accurate predictions on sports channels and podcasts as well as those who like to explore player stats per game season. Our analysis focuses on recent trends from a duration of four seasons

Source of Data
Data comes from a dataset that was originally sourced from basketball reference and can be found in the link below. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html


This project will create a model that is able to predict the points per game of players who play more minutes than the threshold we will have to find in the EDA. Because this project will be ongoing during the start of the 2022-2023 NBA season, we will be able to compare the statistics predicted by the model with actual player data throughout the season. Of course, this project will not take into account injuries that happen this year, and there may be other factors that can affect the stats that a player would have. This model simply uses player data from the last 4-5 years of the NBA in order to make a prediction. 

This data from Basketball Reference details the per game statistics of every player in the NBA for each season. The columns show (per game) the player name, team, position, age, games played, games started, minutes played, field goals, field goals attempted, field goal percentage, free throws, free throw attempts, free throw percentage, 3-point percentage with attempts and makes, 2-point percentage with attempts and makes, effective field goal percentage, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, total rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, and points. Basketball Reference tabulates all of this player data for a given year, and this data can be exported as a CSV. 

Descriptions:

i.Final Project.ipynb: This python notebook contains the code used in achieving the outcome of our research. Additionally, it contains all the other pre-processing and feature engineering done when working on the dataset. This code is to be run as a normal jupyter notebook would be run, though the user can use several functions present in the code to create plots as they need to. 

iii.Final Project Presentation.ppt: The ppt file contains a PowerPoint presentation that details the discoveries made over the course of the analysis. 



Issues and Limitations
The analysis is limited by the amount of data acquired from the last four NBA seasons, so it was limited in the information that we were able to gather in this timeframe.
